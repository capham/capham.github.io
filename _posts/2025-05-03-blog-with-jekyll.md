# üìù Create Free Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

If you're looking to create a **fast**, **free**, and **customizable** blog without relying on third-party platforms, using **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages** is a great option. This setup allows you to host a static site directly from a GitHub repository ‚Äî no servers, no databases, and no monthly fees.

## üöß Basic Steps to Create Your Blog

1. **Install Required Tools**
   - Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
   - Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
   - Create a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account

2. **Set Up a Jekyll Project**
   ```bash
   jekyll new my-blog
   cd my-blog
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Choose a Jekyll Theme**

   One of the most popular and polished themes is **Minimal Mistakes**.

   # in Gemfile
   gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
   ```

   And in `_config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll
   ```

5. **Customize Content**
   - Use Markdown files (`.md`) to create posts and pages
   - Update `_config.yml` to set your site title, description, and navigation
   - Use folders like `_posts`, `_layouts`, and `_includes` to organize content

6. **Deploy with GitHub Pages**
